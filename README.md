# fuzzy-linear-algebra

Linear system of equations have long been studied, with applications in Physics, Statistics and numerous fields of Enginnering. In this report, we investigate linear systems in which variables are fuzzy numbers. We start by giving a direct method for solving such systems and move on to iterative methods such as Guassian-Seidel and Jacobian. We finish the report by implementing aforementioned iterative methods using Sympy and Jupyter Notebook.
